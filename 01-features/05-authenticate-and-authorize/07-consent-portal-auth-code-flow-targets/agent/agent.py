"""Strands agent on AgentCore Runtime, reaching GitHub through a Gateway.

Copy this over the scaffolded project's entrypoint, then deploy:

    agentcore create --name "$AGENT_RUNTIME_NAME" --framework Strands \\
      --model-provider Bedrock --memory none --build CodeZip --defaults
    cp agent/agent.py "$AGENT_RUNTIME_NAME"/app/"$AGENT_RUNTIME_NAME"/main.py
    python deploy/05_patch_agentcore_json.py --entra   # or --okta
    cd "$AGENT_RUNTIME_NAME" && agentcore validate && agentcore deploy -y -v

What the handler does:

  1. Reads the caller's JWT from the Authorization header (allowlisted by
     deploy/05_patch_agentcore_json.py — without that the header is stripped).

  2. Forwards it to the gateway VERBATIM as the MCP Bearer credential. This is
     passthrough, not an OBO token exchange: the runtime and the gateway trust
     the same issuer and audience, so one token satisfies both authorizers.
     That also keeps the identity the gateway resolves for this caller
     identical to the identity they signed in as on the consent portal, which
     is what makes their stored consent findable. (For the OBO variant, where
     each hop gets its own audience, see ../obo-training/3-examples/.)

  3. Lets the LLM pick a GitHub tool. `tools/list` always succeeds because the
     target was created with its schema upfront — nobody has to authorize
     anything to browse the catalogue.

  4. On `tools/call`, the gateway needs the user's GitHub token. If they have
     consented on the portal, it uses the stored token and the call just
     works. If they have NOT, the gateway returns a URL-mode elicitation as a
     JSON-RPC error, code -32042, carrying an AgentCore Identity authorize URL
     in error.data.elicitations[*].url. This handler detects that and replies
     with the CONSENT PORTAL URL instead — the portal authenticates the user,
     gathers consent, and calls CompleteResourceTokenAuth for them. The raw
     identity URL is deliberately not shown: following it directly skips the
     portal's session binding.

Env vars (set by deploy/05_patch_agentcore_json.py):

  - Choose the narrowest tool that answers the question, and pass only the
    arguments you were given or can infer confidently.
  - Summarize results in a couple of sentences unless asked for detail. Do not
    invent repositories, users, or numbers that a tool did not return.
  - If a tool fails because the user has not authorized GitHub access, reply
