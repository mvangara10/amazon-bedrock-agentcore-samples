    "## Lab 1: Creating a simple customer support agent prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) helps you deploying and operating AI agents securely at scale - using any framework and model. It provides you with the capability to move from prototype to production faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this 5-labs tutorial, we will demonstrate the end-to-end journey from prototype to production using a **Customer Support Agent**. For this example we will use [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents and the Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 model from Amazon Bedrock. For your application you can use the framework and model of your choice. It's important to note that the concepts covered here can be applied using other frameworks and models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Current)**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2**: Enhance with Memory - Add conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we'll build a Customer Support Agent prototype that will evolve throughout the workshop into a production-ready system serving multiple customers with persistent memory, shared tools, and full observability. Our agent will have the following local tools available:\n",
    "- **get_return_policy()** - Get return policy for specific products\n",
    "- **get_product_info()** - Get product information\n",
    "- **web_search()** - Search the web for troubleshooting help\n",
